# Changelog

## Dev-v3.0.0 16-MARCH-2021

### Added by Luis

- Changed Lab-Routers area from 666 to 0 (i.e. Backbone area) to facilitate sharing of routes between sites if NSX-T is reconfigured to use OSPF versus eBGP.
  This reconfiguration to use OSPF is not supported by automation, and would have to be done manually afterwards by the user.

## Dev-v3.0.0 31-MARCH-2021

### Added by Luis

- Commented Flash/HHD drive type configuration in ESXi kickstart templates.  Implemented Flash/HDD configuration in custom Ansible module called set_drive_type.  This was needed to support ESXi v7.0 Update 2.
- Updated NSX-T Ansible modules to latest versions found in VMware's NSX-T repository in GitHub.
- Added "SetAsDefault" option for NSX-T TransportZones.  When set to "True", the Transport Zone is set as "Default".
- Added "SetAsDefault" option to existing TransportZones in sample_config.yml file.
- Modified RAM configuration for Nested_ESXi hosts.  Changed all clusters to use 16GB RAM per host.
- Updated sample_config.yml to use the latest versions of ESXi (v7.0U2), NSX-T (v3.1.1), and vRLI (v8.3.0).
- Corrected issue with license_vSphere.yml module where it would fail if a product didn't have licenses.

## Dev-v3.0.0 02-APRIL-2021

### Added by Rutger

## Dev-v3.0.0 6-APRIL-2021

### Added by Rutger

## Dev-v3.0.0 06-APRIL-2021

### Added by Luis

- Added support for eBGP peering with physical Layer-3 Lab-Router, and it is currently ALWAYS enabled.  This functionality may change in the future, especially while in a 'dev' branch.  That said, keep a close eye out for changes around this feature.
- Both IPv4 and IPv6 peering implemented.
- Modified config_sample.yml configuration.
- Added flags to control the origination of Default Routes to eBGP Peers
- Corrected filename used for Pod-Router configuration during deployment
- Added "mtu 1500" statement to Eth0 in Pod-Router configuration
- Corrected type-O in config_sample.yml file
- Default ASN Values are as follows:
  - Lab-Router ASN is 65000
  - Pod-Router ASN is 65000 + Pod.Network
  - NSX-T EdgeVMs ASN is 65000 + Pod.Network + 1

## Dev-v3.0.0 07-APRIL-2021

### Added by Luis

- Changes have been made to the config_sample.yml configuration file with this change.
- Added additional options to Nested_Router.Protocol variable.  Valid options are now "Static", "OSPF", "BGP", and "BOTH" (BGP and OSPF).  This determines the routing protocol(s) used by the Pod-Router into the Lab-Routers network segment (i.e. North Bound).
- Within Nested_Router, the Neighboring BGP routers are now broken up into two (2) sections: Routers and NSXEdges.  Each of these sections are a list, so you can add additional neighbors to fit your needs.  The "Routers" list of bgp neighbors is only instantiated when Nested_Router.Protocol == BGP or BOTH.  The "NSXEdges" is always instantiated when a dynamic routing protocol is chosen.
- Changed the Nested_Router.Protocol value in config_sample.yml from OSPF to BOTH.

## Dev-v3.0.0 10-APRIL-2021

### Added by Rutger

- Added utility "utils/util_UpdateConfig.sh" that can be used to update/create a "config.yml" file with settings based on user input.
- Added utility "utils/util_PodState.yml" that can be used to change virtual machine state of all VMs in a Pod.

## Dev-v3.0.0 10-APRIL-2021

### Added by Luis

- Resolved ISO issues which didn't allow for simultaneous deployments.  Multiple Pod deployments can now be run at the same time.
- Changes have been made to the config_sample.yml configuration file with this change.
- Added new Deploy.Software.Option.UnmountISO variable, which controls if ISOs are unmounted during the deployment process.  Be sure to read comments for that new option.
- TargetConfig.ISOMount is now the base location where all ISOs are now mounted.  Individual ISOs are mounted in subdirectories below this location in the form of: Vendor_Product_Version.  So, vCenter would be: VMware_vCenter_7.00U2
- Converted all modules which mount ISOs to this new ISO mounting scheme.
- Pod_Config.j2 template modified to support the new variable

## Dev-v3.0.0 11-APRIL-2021

### Added by Rutger

- Converted to Ansible FQCN in script "undeploy.yml"

## Dev-v3.0.0 11-APRIL-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu

- Modified ESXi syslog firewall rule entry to permit the server to source from all local IP addresses.

## Dev-v3.0.0 12-APRIL-2021

### Added by Luis Chanu

- Changes have been made to the Pod_Config.j2 template, so please re-run createPodConfig playbook against all of your config files.
- Support for "Legacy" VyOS image (v1.1.8) has been removed/deprecated.  All deployments must now use "Latest" for the Router version.  If you have existing configuration files that are using "Legacy", please be sure to update them.
- ValidateConfiguration.yml playbook updated to verify that the Router version is "Latest".
- Added "FileExt" to all "Software" entries via the Jinja2 template.  This has been added to simplify the ability for an installation process to determine if the installation source is "iso" or "ova".
- The following files were updated, so please update your non-sample files:
  - software_sample.yml
  - templates_sample.yml
